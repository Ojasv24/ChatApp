# OChat a Chat App

I created a chat app in flutter and firebase that has various login methods including Gmail. In the coding process, I used domain-driven architecture and cubit for state management and used an API that creates funny profile photos (for now, there is no option to change the profile photo). I also implemented error handling to ensure a smooth and seamless user experience

## Features

- **Real-time chatting:** The app allows users to chat in real-time, ensuring that they can have quick conversations with others.
- **Newest chat appears at the top:** In the app, the newest chat appears at the top, making it easy for users to see the most recent messages.
- **Chats separated with time stamps:** The app separates chats with time stamps, making it easy for users to see when a particular message was sent.
- **Emoji keyboard:** The app has an emoji keyboard, allowing users to add emojis to their messages.
- **Anyone can talk to anyone:** The app allows users to talk to anyone, regardless of whether they are friends or strangers.
- **User interface:** The app has a modern interface, similar to that of popular messaging apps like Telegram.
